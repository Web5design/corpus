				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I take the emergency exit row on a plane whenever I can get it. Who doesn&#8217;t, right? When the attendants come around and ask if you are willing and able to assist in the event of an emergency, I nod, but think to myself &#8220;My job ends once that door&#8217;s open then I&#8217;m outta here.&#8221; I&#8217;d like to think I would stick around and help carry out the elderly or infirm, but there is a deep and guilty part of me that thinks I wouldn&#8217;t. I would run away.</p>
<p>Running away is an easy way to deal with life. I run when I can because when the exit door&#8217;s open, it&#8217;s much easier than sticking around; trying to help, trying to change, trying to make things better. Easiest to leave and start over, when there&#8217;s a choice. And all I have to say to that is, I am not a good example of humanity and I know this.</p>
<p>When the horrific events of Boston unfolded today, I watched in dismay as did the rest of the world. Hours of &#8220;Who? Why?&#8221; over and over, 15 second Vine videos of the blast, screaming people running away. I turned it off after a bit. I, too, ran away. What were they going to say that made sense? Would someone step forward and say, &#8220;I did this, and this is why,&#8221; and that would somehow explain it? It was a horrific evil act regardless of the perpetrator&#8217;s identity or reasoning, and so I took a break from the nonstop onslaught of smoky images.</p>
<p>But I turned it back on later, to see if there was any new news. I saw that an eight year old died, a child the same age as my own, one who was likely there cheering on a loved one on a happy Patriot&#8217;s Day. And I held my head and turned away, but something in the images starting to come forward changed my mind, despite the despair, despite the urge to run from reality.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-17014" alt="mrrogers" src="http://pawcurious.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/mrrogers-276x300.jpg" width="276" height="300" /></p>
<p>In the seconds after the blast, while confused runners and spectators were fleeing, I saw the first responders sprinting towards the victims. Knowing a second explosion had just hit and unsure if more explosions were coming, still, they ran towards those who needed them. I know a lot of these &#8216;Massholes&#8217;, as they call themselves. I grew up as one. I still drive like one. Massholes run towards.</p>
<p>I saw marathoners, who had planned this event for months and months, robbed in a moment of this happy journey, leave the course and continue running, towards the hospital to donate blood. Elite athletes are often accused of being selfish to the point of narcissism in their quest for glory. They, too, ran towards.</p>
<p>I saw other marathoners, paused on the roadside with their shirts off, tearing them into pieces to apply tourniquets to the victims. The one time I ran a marathon I couldn&#8217;t even remember my name by mile 23 and here they were, at the end, applying first aid knee to knee with spectators. All labels gone, just humans in the thick of things, compelled to run towards.</p>
<p>You may think you have your life on track and then without warning, reason, or explanation, it can derail in a second&#8217;s time, and until it happens, you have no idea of what kind of person you will be. And while there will always be crazy people and awful psychopaths and run of the mill jerks, I&#8217;m reminded of the fact that the reason we consider them sociopaths and villains is because most of us, yes, the vast majority of us, even those we don&#8217;t like or agree with most of the time, are good and want to support our fellow man, not drown him.</p>
<p>Not one of those people stopped to ask a victim, Romney or Obama?</p>
<p>Do you feed raw food or kibble?</p>
<p>Did you rescue your dog or buy a purebred?</p>
<p>Perspective is a precious gift we can find in the most wretched of circumstances. And on this day, I hope that if I ever find myself faced with a choice, I choose to run towards my fellow man.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">When I first began practice as a veterinarian, it took all of about three months before I got tossed out on my own. This was not by choice, mind you. My clinic had opened up a satellite office and sent my ‘mentor’ over to staff the place, leaving me at the main clinic with a couple other part time vets. To be frank, I was glad to have a break from the guy. He was a nightmare. Within one week the entire staff at the new clinic threatened mutiny if they were forced to work with the vet in question one more day, so off I went to be a solo practitioner, an agreement that, had I known what I was getting myself into, I would never have agreed to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Trial by fire: a tale as old as time. And the outcome is usually the same no matter what, a sort of horrified bemusement in retrospect, the realization that That Never Should Have Happened, and a great relief that you survived. Or in this case, my patients. My patients all survived.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Granted, I have a bad habit of rushing into things by myself without the benefit of guidance, mentorship, or advice. That’s how I would up in vet school in the first place, and that worked out ok. That’s how I ended up hiking to a 14K foot peak in Africa with a group of strangers and 0 camping experience. I’ve decided that being the overly cautious risk aversive type that I am, when faced with adequate information, the only way to take a chance in life is to go in with inadequate information- I call it the “too stupid to know better” approach- and hope for the best.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">I realize that this often results in people dying. But for now, it’s working for me.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://pawcurious.com/?attachment_id=17003" rel="attachment wp-att-17003"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-17003" title="riding" src="http://pawcurious.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/riding-1024x388.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="233" /></a></p>
<p> <span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">It was in this spirit that I decided to take my new mountain bike out for a spin yesterday. I needed the exercise. We live in an area with a nice bike trail loop. I’ve done spin classes for a while. How hard could it be?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">As I circled the driveway six or seven times with my shiny new wheels practicing gear changes, it occurred to me that there was a good chance I would end up pushing my bike back home with either a flat tire or a broken ankle, but it was a risk I was willing to take, because I’m not quite sure who would have the patience to walk a novice through bicycling in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">I learned many things out on the trail this sunny morning.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>“Steep” is relative. When pedaling is involved, “gentle incline” = steep.</li>
<li>Taking Brody along in our current condition would be a suicide mission.</li>
<li>I am so glad no one was following me with a cameraphone. Because that scene was ugly.</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">I spent a good amount of time huffing, puffing, cursing, and screaming at branches I mistook for rattlesnakes as I skidded by them. By some miracle I emerged, dusty and unscathed, 50 minutes later having covered probably a mile or so of San Diego’s finest amateur trails.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">I spoke about my misadventures with a friend today, whose husband is into mountain biking. She told me he bought her a $1500 bike and took her to a flat lake area, where he proceeded to chastise her bad form for so long he eventually left her behind as she sat on the curb, crying. She hasn’t ridden it since. That is a perfect analogy for many of my colleagues who have since left the veterinary profession, convinced of their insurmountable inadequacy. Sometimes it’s better to muddle through as you go without the benefit of knowing how badly you are doing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">So far I’ve done a ridiculous amount of things the wrong way- raising kids, writing about vet life even though vets aren’t supposed to blog (“Conventional Wisdom 2008” in action), mixing white wine with red meat, you name it, I’ve messed it up. That being said, constructing life without an instruction manual has been immensely rewarding for me, so I guess I’ll just keep on soldiering on and seeing what happens. Though I do suspect I would benefit from a tire repair kit somewhere along the way.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I spend a lot of time thinking about customer service, and how we as veterinarians are sometimes so focused on being amazing clinicians we neglect to remember the fact that we are in a customer service industry. You can be the most astute diagnostician in the universe, but if your front desk staff or technician (or you!) is  rude, ambivalent or just generally unpleasant, it ruins the whole client experience. It doesn&#8217;t take much to be minimally pleasant, but I&#8217;m amazed how uncommon that has become.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always held Disneyland to be the ultimate in the customer service experience. I remember going as a kid and being followed around the park by chipper young men in starched white uniforms, cheerily scooping up the popcorn we were dripping behind us. &#8220;Have a magical day!&#8221; they&#8217;d wink, and we did. The haunted mansion staff got really into being creepy. My friend, who worked there in high school and college, was taken to task for wearing non regulation pink lipstick. The Disneyland Experience was no joke. Yes, we knew it was fake and those cheery people went home and were crabby humans just like everyone else, but we all appreciated the artifice of good cheer.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://pawcurious.com/?attachment_id=16977" rel="attachment wp-att-16977"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-16977" title="happy" src="http://pawcurious.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/happy.jpg" alt="" width="613" height="445" /></a></p>
<p>I know things have changed a bit. Disney has gotten a little more corporate, the college aged employees too stuck in hipster mode to bring themselves to actually act like they&#8217;re happy, but I had no idea how bad it had gotten until this past week.</p>
<p>My aunt and uncle were visiting from Massachusetts, and my aunt decided she would like to enjoy Disneyland with my kids- who were on Spring Break. My aunt has MS and uses a wheelchair, which as she reminded me allows you some measure of benefit in the form of getting to enter the rides through the exits, thus a shorter line. The kids were happy to hear this.</p>
<p>Now I know Disneyland and I have had our moments in the past- the <a href="http://pawcurious.com/2012/11/flash-mountain/">Splash Mountain debacle</a>, for one, and a heartbreaking encounter with an accordion playing D-list celebrity I <em>used</em> to be a fan of, but still, I figured how could they screw this one up? All you have to do is make some reasonable accommodation for a disabled guest, blah blah Magic of Disney etc, right?</p>
<p>Yeah. It seems somewhere along the way they have forgotten some of Business Tactics 101, applicable to any place hoping to retain customers, be it your friendly local DVM or a once well regarded amusement park.</p>
<p><strong>1. Staff appropriately.</strong></p>
<p>Part of the problem was that we went during spring break, and I know this. That being said, I had to push my aunt hither and fro round each and every ride looking for some guidance as to where one might enter as it seemed like no one was actually working the line. We wandered through Indiana Jones&#8217; exit line for 5 minutes before finding a line of wheelchairs 30 deep marinating in the shadows, staffed by an ambivalent kid in khakis who was not, I suspect, as into archaeology as he should be pretending to be.</p>
<p><strong>2. Anticipate problems.</strong></p>
<p>See someone trying to get through your front door with a huge crate as big as they are? You open the door for them. Same goes for someone trying to back a wheelchair onto a train platform before the door slams shut on someone&#8217;s neuropathic feet. Theoretically. It&#8217;s the little things, right?</p>
<p><strong>3. Keep track of your clients</strong>.</p>
<p>I  heard horror stories of a physician going home for the day, leaving an increasingly agitated client in an exam room who never got past the nurse. I think it&#8217;s reasonable for the person in charge of traffic flow to be keeping an eye on things to make sure no one gets left behind.</p>
<p>Which brings me to my most egregious Disney misadventure to date.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Actually, we have 999 happy haunts residing here but, there&#8217;s always room for 1000. Any volunteers, hmmm?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Anyone who has been on the haunted mansion is familiar with the ride itself: you step onto a moving conveyor belt and run into a little whirl-a-gig buggy thing, ride around for a while getting spooked, and then extricate yourself from said buggy back onto a moving platform. All fine and dandy for those without mobility issues, but it gets dicier when you&#8217;re moving slowly.</p>
<div id="attachment_16976" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 410px"><a href="http://pawcurious.com/?attachment_id=16976" rel="attachment wp-att-16976"><img class="size-full wp-image-16976" title="doombuggies" src="http://pawcurious.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/doombuggies.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Doom buggy, as apropos a title as any.</p></div>
<p>I entered the ride first, with my kids. My mother and aunt got on the buggy behind us, after asking the person running the line to slow it down so she could get on. This is SOP in these cases.</p>
<p>On the other end, I got off with the kids and they started up the one way escalator off the ride. I heard my mother behind me, saying, &#8220;Stop! STOP!&#8221; in louder and louder degrees of panic. Apparently, in a cost cutting measure they got rid of whoever normally stands at the far end to make sure people get off ok, and there was just one girl at the near end of the ride who couldn&#8217;t hear my mother yelling as there was a horde of 30 people pushing off past her. None of whom, by the way, seemed alarmed by my mother&#8217;s distress.</p>
<p>My children, sensing a disturbance and me pausing at the bottom of the escalator, were valiantly attempting to rush back down to me, only to be pushed up by people telling them not to goof off. I turned and saw only the sad sight of my aunt&#8217;s hand hanging out the side, waving sadly to us as she disappeared into a dark tunnel to join the 999 Happy Haunts in parts heretofore unseen.</p>
<p>I went up the escalator after my kids. A few minutes later, my mother appeared, sans aunt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is she?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t know,&#8221; my mother responded, which seemed like a bizarre thing for them to have told her. I mean, she&#8217;s on a fixed belt and can&#8217;t walk, so one might think she would be easy to find. &#8220;They said she&#8217;ll probably pop up at the entrance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Probably. Else they found their thousandth happy haunt.</p>
<p>I went to the entrance, which is an entirely different area, to see if she might arrive there. No one knew where she was there either. My mother, having exited the turnstyle, couldn&#8217;t go back down to the exit to wait for her there. Eventually my aunt texted me: &#8220;Going through again.&#8221;</p>
<p>She did indeed make it back to the entrance, shocking the hell out of the people about to get in the cart with her. The person there stopped the ride and asked her off, but seeing as though her family and her wheelchair were now at the exit, she demurred. Eventually, she arrived back at the egress and had to pick her way, slowly and gingerly, up to the exit turnstyle where my son was frantically holding on to her chair. I had to explain to my kids why I was laughing so hard while we rolled right on out the park and back to our car, pooped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because your auntie is a cool lady,&#8221; I said, marvelling. And she is.</p>
<p>On the bus ride back to the parking lot- which was incidentally the best ride of the day- we were helped by an old-timer named Clarence. &#8220;You don&#8217;t say,&#8221; he said, when we told him of our misadventures. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never heard that one before. Losing a lady on a ride.&#8221; He could barely kneel himself, but he helped me maneuver her chair down the bus ramp.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the little things that stick with us in customer service. But all&#8217;s well that ends well; at least we got her back. <img src='http://pawcurious.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two weeks ago, I had the honor of speaking at the AAHA National Convention as a part of the BlogPaws <a href="http://www.intouchvet.com/aaha13/#sthash.9pTC5rcA.dpbs">veterinary social media</a> track. In a fit of what I can only imagine was perhaps a hypothermia-induced lapse in judgment, Bill Schroeder invited me to co-present for the day.</p>
<div id="attachment_16948" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 564px"><a href="http://pawcurious.com/2013/03/death-match-social-media-vs-rotary/group2/" rel="attachment wp-att-16948"><img class=" wp-image-16948 " title="group2" src="http://pawcurious.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/group2.jpeg" alt="" width="554" height="461" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Bill Schroeder, Dr. Patrick Mahaney, that one person, Tom Collins, Dr. Lorie Huston, Kate Benjamin (courtesy Dr. Patrick Mahaney)</p></div>
<p>For those of you who don&#8217;t know, Bill helms In Touch Vet, a <a href="http://www.InTouchVet.com">veterinary marketing</a> company that works with 8,000 vet clinics across the country with website design and social media. And I, well, I manage one site, which is slightly less impressive, really. He&#8217;s spoken all over the world. I&#8217;ve spoken all over the midwest. I&#8217;m not entirely sure what he was thinking, but I didn&#8217;t want to correct his mistake, so I accepted his offer. And this is why:</p>
<p>Five years ago, there were about three veterinarians on the web. I attended a social media lecture at Western States and they held it in the basement, on Saturday night in Vegas, where a woman with no veterinary experience whatsoever got up in front of the bored looking crowd of 10 and attempted to explain what a &#8220;Facebook&#8221; was. Now, things have changed. I see more vets trying to get on board. I say &#8220;trying&#8221; because this is what tends to happen:</p>
<p>1. They attend a lecture, think to themselves, yup, I should do this.</p>
<p>2. Log onto Facebook, become immediately overwhelmed.</p>
<p>3. Back to work / consider asking receptionist to share some pics from George Takei&#8217;s page, or worse, post some dull news brief from an academic journal.</p>
<p>End experiment.</p>
<p>Done right, social media is fun, and engaging. I wouldn&#8217;t be here all this time later if I didn&#8217;t think that were the case (because trust me, I&#8217;m sure not making a living off writing on this site.) We&#8217;re lucky, as vets: we don&#8217;t need 20,000 fans or fans in Dubai or strangers we&#8217;ve never met, though I like all of those things; we just need a small and loyal group who support what we do. Being here makes me a better vet because it forces me to concentrate on my communication.</p>
<p>So I got up there with Bill, and he said all sorts of profound things and told some great jokes and showed some compelling slides. I watched. I said a few things, the most profound of which was probably my comparison of Twitter to a one-night stand (it&#8217;s not about long term relationships there, and that&#8217;s OK), but the one thing that struck me more than anything was: wow, we&#8217;re all still pretty far behind the eight ball as a profession. That, and the fact that I should wear lower heels when speaking.</p>
<h4>The Fallacy of That One Vet From Michigan</h4>
<p>Let me share with you something someone said after one session: a veterinarian, and I won&#8217;t guess his age because, well, I never do that anymore, came up to us and said: &#8220;yeah, this is great and all, and I&#8217;m sure where you are in <em>San Diego</em> everyone&#8217;s all into this social media thing (I can&#8217;t recall if he used air quotes or not), but I don&#8217;t need this where I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>So we asked where he practiced, and he said, &#8220;Michigan.&#8221; Then he said, &#8220;Only 2% of my clients use social media. I know this. We have data.&#8221; I wasn&#8217;t thinking of calling him a liar, since we are an honest profession of course, so I believed him. But then he said this: &#8220;So I just think maybe we need to focus on our traditional methods of new client recruitment. Like going to Rotary Club.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now look. I like Rotary Club. My father in law is a past president of a well renowned local chapter and the members are amazing. But I think even he would agree, that as a sole way of looking for new faces to come in the door, maybe it is a somewhat limiting strategy.</p>
<h4>Social Media: Old People Like Me Use It Too</h4>
<p>Then I really pondered what he was saying. Only 2% of his current base uses social media. Who are these people, 98% of whom eschew online interaction? Other than the local Rotarians, I mean. We know, generally speaking, that 67% of US adults are active on social media. According to <a href="http://royal.pingdom.com/2012/08/21/report-social-network-demographics-in-2012/">pingdom</a>, half of all social media users are 25-44, with another 20% 45-54. That&#8217;s plenty of middle aged people with pets, I think. More than half are women, who, at least in my practice, show up in the waiting area more than half the time. That works out well.</p>
<p><a href="http://pawcurious.com/2013/03/death-match-social-media-vs-rotary/pingdom/" rel="attachment wp-att-16947"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16947" title="pingdom" src="http://pawcurious.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/pingdom.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="435" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">So I ask myself, does this person live in a small town of Luddites who eschew all forms of web based communication out of a sense of nostalgia? Is there really some place in this country so far off the national average outside of Amish country? Or is he simply handing over, to the clinic down the street, this huge chunk of potential clients who aren&#8217;t even aware his clinic exists because <em>they don&#8217;t go to Rotary meetings</em>? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Maybe it&#8217;s a San Diego thing, but I really can&#8217;t comprehend a town where more pet owners  attend Rotary than go on Facebook, or yelp, or any of the other places we now go to find recommendations for businesses. Perhaps, like the good men and women of the Old Mission Rotary, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Old-Mission-Rotary/125688877204">they do both</a>.</span></p>
<p>I sense from many veterinarians the feeling that the internet, and social media in particular, is overrun with 14 year olds who go onto reddit, post a few LULZ and then get on with their day, none of which involves being the primary caretaker for animals. If that were the case, I would have abandoned ship long ago.</p>
<p>I, however, have spent the last half decade getting to know all of you, and I&#8217;m pretty sure that none of us are shopping in Forever 21. I think we&#8217;re all pretty solidly Ideal Veterinarian Client Demographic: educated, emotionally vested in our animals, and committed to their well being.</p>
<p>Social media: it&#8217;s not just for college kids and Beliebers.</p>
<p>And that connection I share with you all, that sustains me in my moments when I questioned my sanity going into the profession in the first place, is why I wanted to speak at AAHA.</p>
<p>I thought it went well, at least until I saw the first group picture.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I can&#8217;t believe Koa&#8217;s been gone over a month. Sometimes I still look for her around the corner or find some black fur stuck to a sock buried in the laundry pile. We are still adjusting.</p>

<p>I did a quick Google Hangout video talking about some of the lessons I&#8217;ve taken from my own dogs as well as my experience in the clinic. I hope it has some information people find useful, especially to those who have never been through the process before.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You know, I can&#8217;t tell you how many times I had to sit in an exam room with a weeping child, explaining to them over the listless puppy in front of them that I was so sorry, the test came back for Salmonella and the prognosis was grim. Wait, that&#8217;s parvo.</p>
<p>Salmonella, while demonized in the media to a bogeyman of epic proportions, is mostly known as an irritating member of the Diarrhea Duo, a pest more than a demon scourge of canines. And yet, with every recall, the anger, the indignation, and the fear rolls in, predictable as a rush on flu vaccines after the first case of the winter.</p>
<p>I get it. Trust me, I get it. The 2007 melamine recall put us all on edge- and rightly so, I might add. That was a terrible event, one I hope never to see happen again in my career.</p>
<p>There are several factors that went into that event that made it extra awful, mainly the scope, the deception on behalf of the suppliers, and the number of deaths assumed to have resulted from the whole debacle. There is no excuse for deliberately adulterated ingredients to make their way into the pet food supply, ever. And now here we are, with yet another Salmonella recall- on a food I&#8217;m currently feeding Brody. And am I indignant? Disappointed? Filled with righteous fury?</p>
<div id="attachment_16903" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 582px"><a href="http://pawcurious.com/2013/03/omg-salmonella-run-for-your-lives/salmonella/" rel="attachment wp-att-16903"><img class="size-full wp-image-16903" title="salmonella" src="http://pawcurious.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/salmonella.jpg" alt="" width="572" height="480" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Salmonella typhimurium, courtesy NIH.</p></div>
<p>No, not really. But in order to get that you have to understand the ubiquitous nature of Salmonella.</p>
<h4>Salmonella: The scourge of veterinary medicine (except when it isn&#8217;t)</h4>
<p>Let&#8217;s put it this way: if dogs were a preschool, Salmonella would be that runny nose snotty kid always wiping their fingers on everything. It&#8217;s just kind of there, it&#8217;s not there on purpose, but it just kind of happens, and you manage it the best you can. You can peruse pubmed and the various studies on the topic if you want- in fact, NC State is doing research on the very topic of the prevalence of Salmonella in dogs as we speak- the older papers are all over the place, finding 11% to 66% incidence in dogs. A 2002 <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC339295/">Canadian paper on asymptomatic dogs fed the BARF diet</a> found 30% of those dogs tested positive for Salmonella, and, as BARF enthusiasts themselves regularly point out, they are not, as far as anyone can tell, keeling over dead of Salmonellosis in any discernible numbers. This despite the fact that in this study, 80% of their diet did test positive for the bacterium.</p>
<p>So why does the CDC hunt it down like Snape chasing Harry through the halls of Hogwarts? Are they that concerned about the comfort and well being of our canine companions? (hint: no.)</p>
<p>They care because <em>people</em> get Salmonella. The final tally from last year&#8217;s <a href="http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/newpetfoodrecalls/brand_list.cfm?Trade_Name=Diamond&amp;pet=Dog">Diamond incident</a> was that 49 people were sickened, 10 hospitalized, none dead. The CDC stats, when they have them available, average out to about 35 or so people a year getting documented cases of Salmonella from pet food. 35 out of the 42,000 reported cases a year. That&#8217;s <strong>0.08%</strong> of the documented cases being due to pet food, for those keeping score. The actual number of Salmonella cases, most of which are never reported (how many of us had one of those &#8220;OMG I ate bad Taco Bell&#8221; mornings and never reported it?) is estimated to be about 29 times higher. Death rate from acute Salmonellosis? Less than 1%, actually quite a bit lower than even that unless you are very young ,very old, or immunocompromised.</p>
<p>I know you all love infographics. I&#8217;m too cheap to hire a graphic designer, but nonetheless I made you all a pie chart because I know everyone loves a good pie chart.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://pawcurious.com/2013/03/omg-salmonella-run-for-your-lives/pie-chart/" rel="attachment wp-att-16907"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-16907" style="border: 2px solid black; margin-top: 4px; margin-bottom: 4px;" title="Salmonella pie chart" src="http://pawcurious.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/pie-chart.jpg" alt="" width="744" height="360" /></a></p>
<h4>We swim in a sea of Salmonella</h4>
<p>We know, we know and this is well documented, that raw meat is a common source of Salmonella. That is why my mother freaked out, loudly and with great horror, if there was any chicken juice on the counter not promptly blown into oblivion with bleach. &#8220;SALMONELLA!&#8221; she would scream, wielding Lysol like Excalibur against the foe. But as we&#8217;ve seen with a recall from The Honest Kitchen earlier this year, it&#8217;s not just meat that can be the problem- their recall was actually due to a batch of parsley that tested positive. It&#8217;s in the raw ingredients for pet food and the raw ingredients for our own foods. Peanut butter. eggs. chicken. milk.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s the deal? If you want to make a list of the affected brands in the last 5 years, it goes far and wide. Almost everyone has been affected at some point or another. Is it that every single manufacturer, regardless of their commitment to quality control or lack thereof, is just gross and negligent? In certain cases, like the Diamond recall, where there was a well documented failure to maintain adequate facility standards at the manufacturing plant over several months, I would say yes- they screwed up royally.</p>
<p>But in most cases? I would argue that many manufacturers- at least the ones who do it all in house and are transparent enough to invite journalists in &#8211; follow very high levels of quality assurance. The testing process in a plant following adequate GMPS is thorough; the production process is extremely effective at getting rid of pathogens during the cooking process. And even with that, even with everything done properly, sometimes Salmonella happens, just like sometimes you get an infection post-op even when your surgeon followed meticulous sterile procedures.</p>
<p>In yesterday&#8217;s Natura case, we are talking about one single sample that tested positive.</p>
<h4>So now what?</h4>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for an excuse to stop feeding commercial food and this seems like a convenient one, go forth with my blessing. Please find someone who knows that they are talking about (I love the nutritionists at <a href="https://secure.balanceit.com/">BalanceIt)</a> to help guide you.</p>
<p>If you, like the vast majority of the pet owning population including myself, have decided to take your chances with this vile scourge, this baleful bacterium, I give you this long and complicated process to minimize your risks of contracting Salmonella:</p>
<p><strong>1. Wash your hands after touching pet food.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Don&#8217;t buy your kid a live chick for Easter.</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Raising kids is a lot like raising dogs. There&#8217;s a lot of responsibility, a lot of poop, ridiculous amounts of cleaning, and no small amount of frustration. Regardless, the benefits far outweigh the costs, and with a little consistency and training, it&#8217;s all good. Training being the key component.</p>
<p>My son likes Legos and chihuahuas, two things I kind of like but wouldn&#8217;t really say are my &#8220;thing&#8221;. He is his own kid. I realized he was fascinated with mechanical devices more than biological creatures, so I built enough mystique around the Keurig: &#8220;oh no, it&#8217;s MUCH TOO HARD for a kid to work&#8221; etc etc until he insisted- insisted!- that I teach him how to use it, and now he delivers me coffee every morning.</p>
<p>My daughter likes Barbies and Golden retrievers, which, for those of you who know me, you will know must be genetic. So when she came home with an assignment to &#8220;write a presentation on the &#8216;How To&#8217; topic of your choice,&#8221; she announced she wanted to do it about dogs.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to instruct your class in?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;How to groom a dog,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>So she sat down and typed up her outline. &#8220;Get the dog wet, shampoo the dog, dry the dog&#8221; and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>I looked at the presentation software they were supposed to use.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you know you can put pictures in here?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That wasn&#8217;t part of the assignment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you want to go ABOVE and BEYOND, right?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;I mean, you want to knock this out of the park! Right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she said. &#8220;I do. Absolutely.&#8221; She paused. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t have any pictures of me grooming Brody.&#8221;</p>
<p>I paused, looked at the ceiling as if deep in thought, and then said, well, if this is <em>really</em> important to you, I bet I could find a camera.</p>
<p><a href="http://pawcurious.com/?attachment_id=16894" rel="attachment wp-att-16894"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16894" title="L1060075 (2)" src="http://pawcurious.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/L1060075-2.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="374" /></a></p>
<p>And that is how I conned my kid into not only washing Brody, but blow drying him, brushing him out, cleaning up, and thanking me for the opportunity.</p>
<p>Maybe I can pay the teacher off to repeat this assignment once a month through the end of the school year. <img src='http://pawcurious.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I do not profess to know what happens to us after we die. Even those who have strong faith in what will happen to us after we go are sometimes unsure of what happens to our beloved pets. And to them, I quote the great Will Rogers: &#8220;If there are no dogs in Heaven, then when I die I want to go where they went.&#8221;</p>
<p>When someone close to me passes on, be it person or pet, I have a dream about them a week or so later. I don&#8217;t know why, if it is a quirk of my subconscious or an actual visit or who the heck knows; the theologians can debate it all they want, but these particular dreams always stick with me long after I wake and give me a good deal of comfort. And yes, I had a dream about Kekoa a week or so ago, right before the funeral service in our backyard arranged by our daughter and very kindly attended by all four grandparents.</p>
<p>But last night I had a different dream, and regardless of what it means it really struck me because it&#8217;s the only time I&#8217;ve had one like it. Those of you who have been around for a while may remember me <a href="http://pawcurious.com/2010/09/little-earthquakes/">speaking about my grandmother Mary</a>, who passed away several years ago and is the person, I believe, who most set me on the path I am on today as a veterinarian. You may also recall my <a href="http://pawcurious.com/2012/03/elegy-for-carl/">grandfather John</a>, who passed away just under a year ago. It was from him, I later learned, that I got my obsession with adventure and the dream of climbing Mt. Meru, which I accomplished last year.</p>
<p>So in this dream, I am driving around on a grassy hillside and I pull into a driveway, quiet and remote. Another car pulls up, and it&#8217;s my grandmother.</p>
<p>&#8220;Open the window so I can see your face,&#8221; she says. &#8220;It&#8217;s been so long.&#8221;</p>
<p>But I get out instead, and look in her backseat. And there is my dog Mulan, who died of melanoma in 2009, right before I started the blog.</p>
<div id="attachment_16883" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 645px"><a href="http://pawcurious.com/2013/03/i-want-to-go-where-they-went/img_5327/" rel="attachment wp-att-16883"><img class="size-full wp-image-16883" title="IMG_5327" src="http://pawcurious.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_5327.jpg" alt="" width="635" height="423" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Not Brody! This is Mulan and Emmett, in 2008.</p></div>
<p>&#8220;Is she doing better?&#8221; I ask, reaching in as she licks me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course!&#8221; Mary says proudly. &#8220;I know how to take care of animals. She is doing very well.&#8221;</p>
<p>I peer into the drivers seat. &#8220;Is my grandfather up there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she laughs. &#8220;But he doesn&#8217;t want to come out.&#8221; Which is typical.</p>
<p>I pat Mulan, and I start to cry.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221; she asks.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just lost another dog,&#8221; I said. &#8220;She had bone cancer.&#8221;</p>
<p>My grandmother takes my hand, and says, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221; She kisses me and I wake up with a wet pillow.</p>
<p>You know how some dreams are. Some are bizarre flights of fancy, some dreadful chasms of dark worries come to fruition. And others, in those rare and brief moments, sweep you up in their elusive beauty and show you something that stays with you long after you wake. They feel real. And of all the people for Mulan to find on the other side, my sweet dog who was abandoned by an owner who didn&#8217;t feel like treating her flea allergies and wanted me to euthanize her instead, I&#8217;m so glad that at least in my mind, she found Mary.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what it means, or if it means anything. But I am so glad it was a dream I got to have.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I read in an article on CNN the other that that a scant 8% of the population is comprised of &#8216;mega commuters&#8217;, that unlucky club whose commute consists of 90 minutes each way, three hours on the road a day. I felt sorry for them, until I realized I was one of them.</p>
<p>When we moved in December, in search of better schools and a better commute for my spouse, I hadn&#8217;t taken into account what we would do if our home school district didn&#8217;t have space for us. Of course they would, right? Except they didn&#8217;t, and the best they had to offer was another school nearby until the fall. Which would have been ok except for the fact that I already moved the kids&#8217; school once last September, when we thought our house wouldn&#8217;t sell, and the thought of four schools in a year and a half was just more than I could bear for them. I&#8217;ve already put them through enough this year.</p>
<p>So, until this school year ends, despite the move and the promise of a new day and blah blah blah, I&#8217;m dragging my butt up and down one of So Cal&#8217;s most congested freeways four times a day. To school, back home. To pick them up, back home again. 45 minutes each way, 90 minutes roundtrip x twice a day. And I hate driving to begin with.</p>
<p>I tell you this not to elicit sympathy, though if anyone is wondering if California&#8217;s public school system is really as broken as you&#8217;ve heard the answer is an unequivocal &#8216;yes&#8217;. I tell you this by means of explanation as to why I&#8217;m not here, writing. I probably could type in the car, I spend enough time in it just kind of sitting around, but I imagine that sort of thing is frowned upon. So I listen to the radio and think to myself, how lovely it is for my husband that he now has such a short commute, and he better hand over that Sirius subscription stat.</p>
<p>In between driving, and driving some more, I&#8217;m doing all the same sorts of things I&#8217;ve always been doing, it&#8217;s just I no longer seem to be able to find a good 2 1/2 hours a day I used to have for documenting it. So much to say, between Koa&#8217;s funeral and working at Helen Woodward and oh yes, this:</p>
<p>Last weekend we took Brody to a much needed rattlesnake avoidance refresher course:</p>
<p><a href="http://pawcurious.com/2013/03/dr-v-mega-commuter-and-expert-snake-avoider/k32c4278/" rel="attachment wp-att-16870"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16870" title="K32C4278" src="http://pawcurious.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/K32C4278.jpg" alt="" width="508" height="635" /></a></p>
<p>Normally I&#8217;d have lots and lots of pictures, and some video, and a long explanation of the difference between a good course and a useless course, but in my current state all I have to offer is this one photo. Oh, and a picture of a rattlesnake muzzle, in case you were wondering what one looks like:</p>
<p><a href="http://pawcurious.com/2013/03/dr-v-mega-commuter-and-expert-snake-avoider/k32c4345/" rel="attachment wp-att-16869"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16869" title="rattlesnake" src="http://pawcurious.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/K32C4345.jpg" alt="" width="635" height="423" /></a></p>
<p>We shot that from some distance, by the way. The snake&#8217;s mouth is being held shut with a humane snake muzzle (NOT duct tape!) though that doesn&#8217;t make me any more inclined to come closer than 30 feet. I hope someone makes a reality show about these trainer guys someday. They&#8217;ve forgotten more about snakes than I learned in 4 years of vet school.</p>
<p>The short version of an explanation, for those who are wondering, is that we are fortunate in San Diego to have a very professional and well educated team called <a href="http://socalrattlesnakeavoidancetraining.com/">Natural Solutions</a> who offer a top notch rattlesnake aversion course.</p>
<p>There are terrible rattlesnake courses. I know people who have gone though them. I&#8217;ve read about the people who use mops instead of snakes or the wrong snakes or don&#8217;t know how to to properly use the collars or use them on dogs who are just not proper candidates for this type of program. If you&#8217;re wondering how this group works, I encourage you to read their <a href="http://socalrattlesnakeavoidancetraining.com/TrainingProcess.php">FAQ</a> and see why I trust them with Brody. I trust them so much I wrote to my city council lobbying to allow them a venomous snake permit for use within city limits (it was granted, fortunately).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve already seen some snakes out and about on our walks, and this training gives me an added layer of comfort. Though considering I&#8217;m in my car most of the day, if I see one I can simply, you know, drive away.</p>
<p>On the plus side, last day of school is May 31. I&#8217;m throwing a party and you&#8217;re all invited.</p>
