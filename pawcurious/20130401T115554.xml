			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two weeks ago, I had the honor of speaking at the AAHA National Convention as a part of the BlogPaws <a href="http://www.intouchvet.com/aaha13/#sthash.9pTC5rcA.dpbs">veterinary social media</a> track. In a fit of what I can only imagine was perhaps a hypothermia-induced lapse in judgment, Bill Schroeder invited me to co-present for the day.</p>
<div id="attachment_16948" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 564px"><a href="http://pawcurious.com/2013/03/death-match-social-media-vs-rotary/group2/" rel="attachment wp-att-16948"><img class=" wp-image-16948 " title="group2" src="http://pawcurious.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/group2.jpeg" alt="" width="554" height="461" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Bill Schroeder, Dr. Patrick Mahaney, that one person, Tom Collins, Dr. Lorie Huston, Kate Benjamin (courtesy Dr. Patrick Mahaney)</p></div>
<p>For those of you who don&#8217;t know, Bill helms In Touch Vet, a <a href="http://www.InTouchVet.com">veterinary marketing</a> company that works with 8,000 vet clinics across the country with website design and social media. And I, well, I manage one site, which is slightly less impressive, really. He&#8217;s spoken all over the world. I&#8217;ve spoken all over the midwest. I&#8217;m not entirely sure what he was thinking, but I didn&#8217;t want to correct his mistake, so I accepted his offer. And this is why:</p>
<p>Five years ago, there were about three veterinarians on the web. I attended a social media lecture at Western States and they held it in the basement, on Saturday night in Vegas, where a woman with no veterinary experience whatsoever got up in front of the bored looking crowd of 10 and attempted to explain what a &#8220;Facebook&#8221; was. Now, things have changed. I see more vets trying to get on board. I say &#8220;trying&#8221; because this is what tends to happen:</p>
<p>1. They attend a lecture, think to themselves, yup, I should do this.</p>
<p>2. Log onto Facebook, become immediately overwhelmed.</p>
<p>3. Back to work / consider asking receptionist to share some pics from George Takei&#8217;s page, or worse, post some dull news brief from an academic journal.</p>
<p>End experiment.</p>
<p>Done right, social media is fun, and engaging. I wouldn&#8217;t be here all this time later if I didn&#8217;t think that were the case (because trust me, I&#8217;m sure not making a living off writing on this site.) We&#8217;re lucky, as vets: we don&#8217;t need 20,000 fans or fans in Dubai or strangers we&#8217;ve never met, though I like all of those things; we just need a small and loyal group who support what we do. Being here makes me a better vet because it forces me to concentrate on my communication.</p>
<p>So I got up there with Bill, and he said all sorts of profound things and told some great jokes and showed some compelling slides. I watched. I said a few things, the most profound of which was probably my comparison of Twitter to a one-night stand (it&#8217;s not about long term relationships there, and that&#8217;s OK), but the one thing that struck me more than anything was: wow, we&#8217;re all still pretty far behind the eight ball as a profession. That, and the fact that I should wear lower heels when speaking.</p>
<h4>The Fallacy of That One Vet From Michigan</h4>
<p>Let me share with you something someone said after one session: a veterinarian, and I won&#8217;t guess his age because, well, I never do that anymore, came up to us and said: &#8220;yeah, this is great and all, and I&#8217;m sure where you are in <em>San Diego</em> everyone&#8217;s all into this social media thing (I can&#8217;t recall if he used air quotes or not), but I don&#8217;t need this where I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>So we asked where he practiced, and he said, &#8220;Michigan.&#8221; Then he said, &#8220;Only 2% of my clients use social media. I know this. We have data.&#8221; I wasn&#8217;t thinking of calling him a liar, since we are an honest profession of course, so I believed him. But then he said this: &#8220;So I just think maybe we need to focus on our traditional methods of new client recruitment. Like going to Rotary Club.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now look. I like Rotary Club. My father in law is a past president of a well renowned local chapter and the members are amazing. But I think even he would agree, that as a sole way of looking for new faces to come in the door, maybe it is a somewhat limiting strategy.</p>
<h4>Social Media: Old People Like Me Use It Too</h4>
<p>Then I really pondered what he was saying. Only 2% of his current base uses social media. Who are these people, 98% of whom eschew online interaction? Other than the local Rotarians, I mean. We know, generally speaking, that 67% of US adults are active on social media. According to <a href="http://royal.pingdom.com/2012/08/21/report-social-network-demographics-in-2012/">pingdom</a>, half of all social media users are 25-44, with another 20% 45-54. That&#8217;s plenty of middle aged people with pets, I think. More than half are women, who, at least in my practice, show up in the waiting area more than half the time. That works out well.</p>
<p><a href="http://pawcurious.com/2013/03/death-match-social-media-vs-rotary/pingdom/" rel="attachment wp-att-16947"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16947" title="pingdom" src="http://pawcurious.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/pingdom.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="435" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">So I ask myself, does this person live in a small town of Luddites who eschew all forms of web based communication out of a sense of nostalgia? Is there really some place in this country so far off the national average outside of Amish country? Or is he simply handing over, to the clinic down the street, this huge chunk of potential clients who aren&#8217;t even aware his clinic exists because <em>they don&#8217;t go to Rotary meetings</em>? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Maybe it&#8217;s a San Diego thing, but I really can&#8217;t comprehend a town where more pet owners Â attend Rotary than go on Facebook, or yelp, or any of the other places we now go to find recommendations for businesses. Perhaps, like the good men and women of the Old Mission Rotary, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Old-Mission-Rotary/125688877204">they do both</a>.</span></p>
<p>I sense from many veterinarians the feeling that the internet, and social media in particular, is overrun with 14 year olds who go onto reddit, post a few LULZ and then get on with their day, none of which involves being the primary caretaker for animals. If that were the case, I would have abandoned ship long ago.</p>
<p>I, however, have spent the last half decade getting to know all of you, and I&#8217;m pretty sure that none of us are shopping in Forever 21. I think we&#8217;re all pretty solidly Ideal Veterinarian Client Demographic: educated, emotionally vested in our animals, and committed to their well being.</p>
<p>Social media: it&#8217;s not just for college kids and Beliebers.</p>
<p>And that connection I share with you all, that sustains me in my moments when I questioned my sanity going into the profession in the first place, is why I wanted to speak at AAHA.</p>
<p>I thought it went well, at least until I saw the first group picture.</p>

<p>I did a quick Google Hangout video talking about some of the lessons I&#8217;ve taken from my own dogs as well as my experience in the clinic. I hope it has some information people find useful, especially to those who have never been through the process before.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You know, I can&#8217;t tell you how many times I had to sit in an exam room with a weeping child, explaining to them over the listless puppy in front of them that I was so sorry, the test came back for Salmonella and the prognosis was grim. Wait, that&#8217;s parvo.</p>
<p>Salmonella, while demonized in the media to a bogeyman of epic proportions, is mostly known as an irritating member of the Diarrhea Duo, a pest more than a demon scourge of canines. And yet, with every recall, the anger, the indignation, and the fear rolls in, predictable as a rush on flu vaccines after the first case of the winter.</p>
<p>I get it. Trust me, I get it. The 2007 melamine recall put us all on edge- and rightly so, I might add. That was a terrible event, one I hope never to see happen again in my career.</p>
<p>There are several factors that went into that event that made it extra awful, mainly the scope, the deception on behalf of the suppliers, and the number of deaths assumed to have resulted from the whole debacle. There is no excuse for deliberately adulterated ingredients to make their way into the pet food supply, ever. And now here we are, with yet another Salmonella recall- on a food I&#8217;m currently feeding Brody. And am I indignant? Disappointed? Filled with righteous fury?</p>
<div id="attachment_16903" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 582px"><a href="http://pawcurious.com/2013/03/omg-salmonella-run-for-your-lives/salmonella/" rel="attachment wp-att-16903"><img class="size-full wp-image-16903" title="salmonella" src="http://pawcurious.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/salmonella.jpg" alt="" width="572" height="480" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Salmonella typhimurium, courtesy NIH.</p></div>
<p>No, not really. But in order to get that you have to understand the ubiquitous nature of Salmonella.</p>
<h4>Salmonella: The scourge of veterinary medicine (except when it isn&#8217;t)</h4>
<p>Let&#8217;s put it this way: if dogs were a preschool, Salmonella would be that runny nose snotty kid always wiping their fingers on everything. It&#8217;s just kind of there, it&#8217;s not there on purpose, but it just kind of happens, and you manage it the best you can. You can peruse pubmed and the various studies on the topic if you want- in fact, NC State is doing research on the very topic of the prevalence of Salmonella in dogs as we speak- the older papers are all over the place, finding 11% to 66% incidence in dogs. A 2002 <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC339295/">Canadian paper on asymptomatic dogs fed the BARF diet</a> found 30% of those dogs tested positive for Salmonella, and, as BARF enthusiasts themselves regularly point out, they are not, as far as anyone can tell, keeling over dead of Salmonellosis in any discernible numbers. This despite the fact that in this study, 80% of their diet did test positive for the bacterium.</p>
<p>So why does the CDC hunt it down like Snape chasing Harry through the halls of Hogwarts? Are they that concerned about the comfort and well being of our canine companions? (hint: no.)</p>
<p>They care because <em>people</em> get Salmonella. The final tally from last year&#8217;s <a href="http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/newpetfoodrecalls/brand_list.cfm?Trade_Name=Diamond&amp;pet=Dog">Diamond incident</a> was that 49 people were sickened, 10 hospitalized, none dead. The CDC stats, when they have them available, average out to about 35 or so people a year getting documented cases of Salmonella from pet food. 35 out of the 42,000 reported cases a year. That&#8217;s <strong>0.08%</strong> of the documented cases being due to pet food, for those keeping score. The actual number of Salmonella cases, most of which are never reported (how many of us had one of those &#8220;OMG I ate bad Taco Bell&#8221; mornings and never reported it?) is estimated to be about 29 times higher. Death rate from acute Salmonellosis? Less than 1%, actually quite a bit lower than even that unless you are very young ,very old, or immunocompromised.</p>
<p>I know you all love infographics. I&#8217;m too cheap to hire a graphic designer, but nonetheless I made you all a pie chart because I know everyone loves a good pie chart.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://pawcurious.com/2013/03/omg-salmonella-run-for-your-lives/pie-chart/" rel="attachment wp-att-16907"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-16907" style="border: 2px solid black; margin-top: 4px; margin-bottom: 4px;" title="Salmonella pie chart" src="http://pawcurious.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/pie-chart.jpg" alt="" width="744" height="360" /></a></p>
<h4>We swim in a sea of Salmonella</h4>
<p>We know, we know and this is well documented, that raw meat is a common source of Salmonella. That is why my mother freaked out, loudly and with great horror, if there was any chicken juice on the counter not promptly blown into oblivion with bleach. &#8220;SALMONELLA!&#8221; she would scream, wielding Lysol like Excalibur against the foe. But as we&#8217;ve seen with a recall from The Honest Kitchen earlier this year, it&#8217;s not just meat that can be the problem- their recall was actually due to a batch of parsley that tested positive. It&#8217;s in the raw ingredients for pet food and the raw ingredients for our own foods. Peanut butter. eggs. chicken. milk.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s the deal? If you want to make a list of the affected brands in the last 5 years, it goes far and wide. Almost everyone has been affected at some point or another. Is it that every single manufacturer, regardless of their commitment to quality control or lack thereof, is just gross and negligent? In certain cases, like the Diamond recall, where there was a well documented failure to maintain adequate facility standards at the manufacturing plant over several months, I would say yes- they screwed up royally.</p>
<p>But in most cases? I would argue that many manufacturers- at least the ones who do it all in house and are transparent enough to invite journalists in &#8211; follow very high levels of quality assurance. The testing process in a plant following adequate GMPS is thorough; the production process is extremely effective at getting rid of pathogens during the cooking process. And even with that, even with everything done properly, sometimes Salmonella happens, just like sometimes you get an infection post-op even when your surgeon followed meticulous sterile procedures.</p>
<p>In yesterday&#8217;s Natura case, we are talking about one single sample that tested positive.</p>
<h4>So now what?</h4>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for an excuse to stop feeding commercial food and this seems like a convenient one, go forth with my blessing. Please find someone who knows that they are talking about (I love the nutritionists at <a href="https://secure.balanceit.com/">BalanceIt)</a> to help guide you.</p>
<p>If you, like the vast majority of the pet owning population including myself, have decided to take your chances with this vile scourge, this baleful bacterium, I give you this long and complicated process to minimize your risks of contracting Salmonella:</p>
<p><strong>1. Wash your hands after touching pet food.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Don&#8217;t buy your kid a live chick for Easter.</strong></p>

<p><strong>P.S. I thought this goes without saying, but just in case there was some ambiguity: good lord, if your food lot gets recalled, yes, do return it. That&#8217;s what recalls are for.</strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Raising kids is a lot like raising dogs. There&#8217;s a lot of responsibility, a lot of poop, ridiculous amounts of cleaning, and no small amount of frustration. Regardless, the benefits far outweigh the costs, and with a little consistency and training, it&#8217;s all good. Training being the key component.</p>
<p>My son likes Legos and chihuahuas, two things I kind of like but wouldn&#8217;t really say are my &#8220;thing&#8221;. He is his own kid. I realized he was fascinated with mechanical devices more than biological creatures, so I built enough mystique around the Keurig: &#8220;oh no, it&#8217;s MUCH TOO HARD for a kid to work&#8221; etc etc until he insisted- insisted!- that I teach him how to use it, and now he delivers me coffee every morning.</p>
<p>My daughter likes Barbies and Golden retrievers, which, for those of you who know me, you will know must be genetic. So when she came home with an assignment to &#8220;write a presentation on the &#8216;How To&#8217; topic of your choice,&#8221; she announced she wanted to do it about dogs.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to instruct your class in?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;How to groom a dog,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>So she sat down and typed up her outline. &#8220;Get the dog wet, shampoo the dog, dry the dog&#8221; and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>I looked at the presentation software they were supposed to use.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you know you can put pictures in here?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That wasn&#8217;t part of the assignment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you want to go ABOVE and BEYOND, right?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;I mean, you want to knock this out of the park! Right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she said. &#8220;I do. Absolutely.&#8221; She paused. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t have any pictures of me grooming Brody.&#8221;</p>
<p>I paused, looked at the ceiling as if deep in thought, and then said, well, if this is <em>really</em> important to you, I bet I could find a camera.</p>
<p><a href="http://pawcurious.com/?attachment_id=16894" rel="attachment wp-att-16894"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16894" title="L1060075 (2)" src="http://pawcurious.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/L1060075-2.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="374" /></a></p>
<p>And that is how I conned my kid into not only washing Brody, but blow drying him, brushing him out, cleaning up, and thanking me for the opportunity.</p>
<p>Maybe I can pay the teacher off to repeat this assignment once a month through the end of the school year. <img src='http://pawcurious.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I do not profess to know what happens to us after we die. Even those who have strong faith in what will happen to us after we go are sometimes unsure of what happens to our beloved pets. And to them, I quote the great Will Rogers: &#8220;If there are noÂ dogsÂ in Heaven, then when I die I want to go where they went.&#8221;</p>
<p>When someone close to me passes on, be it person or pet, I have a dream about them a week or so later. I don&#8217;t know why, if it is a quirk of my subconscious or an actual visit or who the heck knows; the theologians can debate it all they want, but these particular dreams always stick with me long after I wake and give me a good deal of comfort. And yes, I had a dream about Kekoa a week or so ago, right before the funeral service in our backyard arranged by our daughter and very kindly attended by all four grandparents.</p>
<p>But last night I had a different dream, and regardless of what it means it really struck me because it&#8217;s the only time I&#8217;ve had one like it. Those of you who have been around for a while may remember me <a href="http://pawcurious.com/2010/09/little-earthquakes/">speaking about my grandmother Mary</a>, who passed away several years ago and is the person, I believe, who most set me on the path I am on today as a veterinarian. You may also recall my <a href="http://pawcurious.com/2012/03/elegy-for-carl/">grandfather John</a>, who passed away just under a year ago. It was from him, I later learned, that I got my obsession with adventure and the dream of climbing Mt. Meru, which I accomplished last year.</p>
<p>So in this dream, I am driving around on a grassy hillside and I pull into a driveway, quiet and remote. Another car pulls up, and it&#8217;s my grandmother.</p>
<p>&#8220;Open the window so I can see your face,&#8221; she says. &#8220;It&#8217;s been so long.&#8221;</p>
<p>But I get out instead, and look in her backseat. And there is my dog Mulan, who died of melanoma in 2009, right before I started the blog.</p>
<div id="attachment_16883" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 645px"><a href="http://pawcurious.com/2013/03/i-want-to-go-where-they-went/img_5327/" rel="attachment wp-att-16883"><img class="size-full wp-image-16883" title="IMG_5327" src="http://pawcurious.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_5327.jpg" alt="" width="635" height="423" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Not Brody! This is Mulan and Emmett, in 2008.</p></div>
<p>&#8220;Is she doing better?&#8221; I ask, reaching in as she licks me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course!&#8221; Mary says proudly. &#8220;I know how to take care of animals. She is doing very well.&#8221;</p>
<p>I peer into the drivers seat. &#8220;Is my grandfather up there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she laughs. &#8220;But he doesn&#8217;t want to come out.&#8221; Which is typical.</p>
<p>I pat Mulan, and I start to cry.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221; she asks.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just lost another dog,&#8221; I said. &#8220;She had bone cancer.&#8221;</p>
<p>My grandmother takes my hand, and says, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221; She kisses me and I wake up with a wet pillow.</p>
<p>You know how some dreams are. Some are bizarre flights of fancy, some dreadful chasms of dark worries come to fruition. And others, in those rare and brief moments, sweep you up in their elusive beauty and show you something that stays with you long after you wake. They feel real. And of all the people for Mulan to find on the other side, my sweet dog who was abandoned by an owner who didn&#8217;t feel like treating her flea allergies and wanted me to euthanize her instead, I&#8217;m so glad that at least in my mind, she found Mary.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what it means, or if it means anything. But I am so glad it was a dream I got to have.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I read in an article on CNN the other that that a scant 8% of the population is comprised of &#8216;mega commuters&#8217;, that unlucky club whose commute consists of 90 minutes each way, three hours on the road a day. I felt sorry for them, until I realized I was one of them.</p>
<p>When we moved in December, in search of better schools and a better commute for my spouse, I hadn&#8217;t taken into account what we would do if our home school district didn&#8217;t have space for us. Of course they would, right? Except they didn&#8217;t, and the best they had to offer was another school nearby until the fall. Which would have been ok except for the fact that I already moved the kids&#8217; school once last September, when we thought our house wouldn&#8217;t sell, and the thought of four schools in a year and a half was just more than I could bear for them. I&#8217;ve already put them through enough this year.</p>
<p>So, until this school year ends, despite the move and the promise of a new day and blah blah blah, I&#8217;m dragging my butt up and down one of So Cal&#8217;s most congested freeways four times a day. To school, back home. To pick them up, back home again. 45 minutes each way, 90 minutes roundtrip x twice a day. And I hate driving to begin with.</p>
<p>I tell you this not to elicit sympathy, though if anyone is wondering if California&#8217;s public school system is really as broken as you&#8217;ve heard the answer is an unequivocal &#8216;yes&#8217;. I tell you this by means of explanation as to why I&#8217;m not here, writing. I probably could type in the car, I spend enough time in it just kind of sitting around, but I imagine that sort of thing is frowned upon. So I listen to the radio and think to myself, how lovely it is for my husband that he now has such a short commute, and he better hand over that Sirius subscription stat.</p>
<p>In between driving, and driving some more, I&#8217;m doing all the same sorts of things I&#8217;ve always been doing, it&#8217;s just I no longer seem to be able to find a good 2 1/2 hours a day I used to have for documenting it. So much to say, between Koa&#8217;s funeral and working at Helen Woodward and oh yes, this:</p>
<p>Last weekend we took Brody to a much needed rattlesnake avoidance refresher course:</p>
<p><a href="http://pawcurious.com/2013/03/dr-v-mega-commuter-and-expert-snake-avoider/k32c4278/" rel="attachment wp-att-16870"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16870" title="K32C4278" src="http://pawcurious.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/K32C4278.jpg" alt="" width="508" height="635" /></a></p>
<p>Normally I&#8217;d have lots and lots of pictures, and some video, and a long explanation of the difference between a good course and a useless course, but in my current state all I have to offer is this one photo. Oh, and a picture of a rattlesnake muzzle, in case you were wondering what one looks like:</p>
<p><a href="http://pawcurious.com/2013/03/dr-v-mega-commuter-and-expert-snake-avoider/k32c4345/" rel="attachment wp-att-16869"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16869" title="rattlesnake" src="http://pawcurious.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/K32C4345.jpg" alt="" width="635" height="423" /></a></p>
<p>We shot that from some distance, by the way. The snake&#8217;s mouth is being held shut with a humane snake muzzle (NOT duct tape!) though that doesn&#8217;t make me any more inclined to come closer than 30 feet. I hope someone makes a reality show about these trainer guys someday. They&#8217;ve forgotten more about snakes than I learned in 4 years of vet school.</p>
<p>The short version of an explanation, for those who are wondering, is that we are fortunate in San Diego to have a very professional and well educated team called <a href="http://socalrattlesnakeavoidancetraining.com/">Natural Solutions</a> who offer a top notch rattlesnake aversion course.</p>
<p>There are terrible rattlesnake courses. I know people who have gone though them. I&#8217;ve read about the people who use mops instead of snakes or the wrong snakes or don&#8217;t know how to to properly use the collars or use them on dogs who are just not proper candidates for this type of program. If you&#8217;re wondering how this group works, I encourage you to read their <a href="http://socalrattlesnakeavoidancetraining.com/TrainingProcess.php">FAQ</a> and see why I trust them with Brody. I trust them so much I wrote to my city council lobbying to allow them a venomous snake permit for use within city limits (it was granted, fortunately).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve already seen some snakes out and about on our walks, and this training gives me an added layer of comfort. Though considering I&#8217;m in my car most of the day, if I see one I can simply, you know, drive away.</p>
<p>On the plus side, last day of school is May 31. I&#8217;m throwing a party and you&#8217;re all invited.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today&#8217;s the day- <a href="http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/spay_day/">2013 Annual World Spay Day</a>! I have to tell you, it doesn&#8217;t tickle the old joy centers quite the way, say, Ben and Jerry&#8217;s Free Ice Cream Cone Day does, but it&#8217;s here and I&#8217;m glad it exists.</p>
<p><a href="http://pawcurious.com/2013/02/its-world-spay-day/spayday/" rel="attachment wp-att-16852"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16852" title="spayday" src="http://pawcurious.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/spayday.jpg" alt="" width="685" height="187" /></a></p>
<p>Now, two things to note before I give my thoughts:</p>
<p>1. Although it&#8217;s called &#8220;Spay Day&#8221;, the event encompasses both spay and neuter. Nobody&#8217;s trying to leave the fellas out, I think it just rolls off the tongue better this way.</p>
<p>2. Yes, I know it&#8217;s a Humane Society of the United States initiative and that is making at least five of you raise your eyebrows. That being said, I do think it&#8217;s important to recognize and support good initiatives no matter where they originate, and this is one. Lots of other organizations, such as PetSmart Charities, Petfinder, and the ASPCA, agree enough to be an official part of the event.</p>
<p>This question of whether to spay and neuter has become somewhat controversial as of late. And to that I say, let&#8217;s talk about it. Politely, please. As long as it took me to perfect my gentle tissue handling skills I really take issue with being accused of ripping uteri out of unwitting pets willy-nilly for no good reason.</p>
<h3><strong>I Spay</strong></h3>
<p>I am a spay/neuter advocate. Anyone who has worked even a little in a shelter environment becomes one really fast- because when you are faced with the reality:</p>
<p>Of 10,000 faces.</p>
<p><a title="walle3 by pawcurious - visit http://www.pawcurious.com, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pawcurious/5527965011/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5257/5527965011_b02f3e8898_z.jpg" alt="walle3" width="640" height="559" /></a></p>
<p>No, wait, that&#8217;s not 10,000.</p>
<p><a title="walle2 by pawcurious - visit http://www.pawcurious.com, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pawcurious/5527962611/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5219/5527962611_378ff7c49f_z.jpg" alt="walle2" width="640" height="558" /></a></p>
<p>No, wait. That&#8217;s not 10,000 either. THIS is 10,000:</p>
<p><a title="walle 10,000 by pawcurious - visit http://www.pawcurious.com, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pawcurious/5528551292/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5136/5528551292_c9c7f7833f_z.jpg" alt="walle 10,000" width="640" height="558" /></a></p>
<p>10,000 faces A DAY euthanized in US shelters, makes it hard to argue against anything that will help reduce those numbers. Which is why I will support low cost spay/neuter clinics, even if it cuts into my own professional workload (though it never seemed to, even in my lower income area of practice.)</p>
<p>My clinic referred people all the time; our surgery protocol was absolutely top notch, but it came with an appropriate pricetag. Given the choice between a subsidized clinic down the road or no surgery at all, we knew what was the right thing to do. Money&#8217;s tight these days. I get that. I am glad there are resources around for those who need it.</p>
<p><a href="https://spaydayportal.humanesociety.org/spayorneuteryourpet/us/">Spay Day</a>Â has an <a href="https://spaydayportal.humanesociety.org/sd_findEvent_US.aspx">event locator</a> for people to find local Spay Day events. As an example, h<a href="https://spaydayportal.humanesociety.org/sd_findEventDetails.aspx?eventId=1768">ere&#8217;s an event from my neck of the woods</a>: $10 to fix any pet whose owners reside in a particular school district. I can&#8217;t compete with that, but truth be told, I probably never was in the running for most of the business to begin with. Whatever the outcome, one less litter in the Sweetwater shelter is OK by me.</p>
<h3>But gonads are good! Don&#8217;t you deny it!</h3>
<p>But WAIT! I know what you&#8217;re going to say. You are an educated, informed pet owner and you know all about the research showing that sex hormones do have health benefits and spaying and neutering may not always be 100% a positive thing. You&#8217;ve pored over the latest <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0055937">Golden Retriever neutering and cancer study</a> (I did too. Putting 2 Goldens down in 6 months is not a fun thing.) And you ask:</p>
<p>Why must I be forced into this surgery for my pet? <em>Why is no one admitting that testicles and ovaries have a purpose and are best left attached to the animal from whence they sprouted?</em></p>
<p>To this I say: I agree.</p>
<p>And to that I add: Will you at least concede, being an educated, informed pet owner, the sad truth that many, many people are not? And while I can say with utter sincerity that I believe you are not letting your pet run amuk impregnating the neighborhood, your less conscientious streetmates are?</p>
<p>We need to look at the conversation on two different levels: Individual health and population health.</p>
<p><strong>I believe</strong> individual owners should have the right to decide when and if their pets are spayed and neutered. It&#8217;s my job to help you evaluate the risk/benefit analysis and decide for yourself what is right for you, what the consequences of that choices might be, and how to proceed. Should you make an <em>informed</em> decision not to spay and neuter, I will support you. I know you people exist. I&#8217;ve met you. However:</p>
<p><strong>I also believe</strong> that from a population standpoint, in the absence of an owner who makes that level of commitment to understanding the complexity of the issue- or any issue regarding their dog, really- the default recommendation should be: spay and neuter. If you got your cryptorchid puppy off Craigslist and waited three months to bring him in for his first parvo vaccine, I&#8217;m going to recommend neutering him. If you are a local news personality and you Tweet me asking me whether you should buy a dog with an umbilical hernia if you intend to breed her&#8230;.not that that happened&#8230;OK, it just happened&#8230;but do you see what I mean? There are a lot of people out there making, as I explain it to my children, &#8220;poor decisions.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Â </span><br />
<a title="Untitled by pawcurious - visit http://www.pawcurious.com, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pawcurious/8201799702/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8478/8201799702_6ff8281064_z.jpg" alt="Untitled" width="640" height="427" /></a></p>
<p>Nowhere is the benefit of spay/neuter more apparent to me than in Granada, where World Vets started performing the surgeries half a decade ago. You might have walked through there in 2002 and marveled that the stray dogs all seemed so young and vibrant, but here&#8217;s the truth: that&#8217;s because they usually died, starving or in pain, by age 4.</p>
<p>Those people who live there will tell you, with awe in their voices, how much healthier the overall animal population is. How much nicer it is to walk down the street and not see a dead starved dog in a ditch. Those of you educated enough to appreciate the benefits of an intact pet are certainly educated enough to appreciate in the big picture, that might not apply. If not, come on down to Granada and I&#8217;ll show you a<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmissible_venereal_tumour"> TVT</a>.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t evaluate the necessity of spay/neuter campaigns in a vacuum; so to sum up, here you go:</p>
<h4>TLDR: If you choose not to spay or neuter your dog because you&#8217;re responsible and educated enough to have decided that is right for you, I&#8217;m here for you. And while I will support you in that I hope you will also acknowledge that for millions of animals out there, spay/neuter IS the best choice, so do me a solid and don&#8217;t undermine my efforts to alleviate significant suffering in spheres outside your own. Deal? Group hug.</h4>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists have long been fascinated with the concept of &#8220;muscle memory&#8221;, that subconscious part of our brain that controls movement without us having to think about it. It&#8217;s what allows us to do complicated tasks such as riding a bike or typing &#8220;the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog&#8221; without having to stop and say, OK, I need to contract my left hamstring while extending my right quadricep and all those tricky things that go into motion. It&#8217;s what allows me to tie a knot during surgery without the laborious thought process that takes place during learning &#8220;around the forceps from the front? or the back?&#8221; After a while, it just happens.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s funny how it pops up in the most unexpected places. For the past 3 years, Kekoa has been my footrest. I literally could not sit in the house without her wedging herself beneath my feet. Now, my feet head toward the floor, expecting a mass to bring them to a halt about 12 inches off the ground. I don&#8217;t think about it or calibrate their momentum, they just go with the intent that they will hit fur. Without her there, they crash repeatedly into the floor, each time a jarring reminder of what is no longer there.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s odd to me how strong those tangible physical reminders can be. For some reason, I can&#8217;t remember the exact timbre of my individual dogs&#8217; barks- and I know they were all quite distinctive- but to a one I can tell you how their heads felt in my hands. Taffy, light as a feather, ready to nip at the slightest provocation. Nuke, needle-nosed and gently, resting into your palm. Emmett, like a solid football, sturdy and reassuring. Mulan, like a brick, wide and solid.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://pawcurious.com/2013/02/muscle-memory/koa1/" rel="attachment wp-att-16846"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-16846" title="koa1" src="http://pawcurious.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/koa1.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="410" /></a></p>
<p>Kekoa&#8217;s head was disproportionately small compared to the rest of her body. She looked somewhat like an engorged tick, but in a nice way. She would lumber over and plop on your feet, her manticore tail smacking into the wall with such force you&#8217;d think someone was cracking a whip on the drywall. She never seemed to notice. Such was her excitement that she would hover over you, massive, looming, and then with the gentlest motion ease her tiny head into your hands and cover them with kisses. You&#8217;d try to push her head away when you had enough but then she&#8217;d kiss that hand too, so eventually you&#8217;d just give up. Her tail wouldn&#8217;t stop wagging the whole time.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://pawcurious.com/2013/02/muscle-memory/koa2/" rel="attachment wp-att-16845"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-16845" title="koa2" src="http://pawcurious.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/koa2.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="410" /></a></p>
<p>She had a terrible wail. A piercing bark so heartbreaking and eardrum-wrenching that she lost two homes because of it. We used our baby monitor to listen in while we were away, and eventually I had to stop because it was too much to listen to.</p>
<p>That sound I can&#8217;t bring up. Already, I&#8217;ve forgotten it. But the sound of her tail hitting the cabinet, and the feel of her head in my hand- those will be with me forever.</p>
<p>Are there any strangely strong memories you carry with your pets who have moved on?</p>
