<li>The goods &#8211; benefits (salary, accommodation, vacation time, etc.)</li>
<li>TEFL certification programs they used</li>
<li>Favorite and least favorite parts of teaching English in Korea</li>
<li>Their social life, mingling with other expats, and learning basic Korean</li>

<li>Lots of advice about teaching English in Korea</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8230; and so much more!</p>
<p><strong>Connect with Sam and Audrey</strong></p>
<p>Sam and Audrey were super helpful, down to Earth, and I really appreciated them sitting down with me to chat. They even went to a quiet cafe with good Internet to ensure a good connection. Thanks you two! Make sure to head over to their websites and connect with them via social media.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://atlassliced.com/live-and-work-abroad-rockstars/"><![CDATA[<p>Today&#8217;s slice (post) is a little different. There&#8217;s no video. Instead, I&#8217;m giving a shout-out to 10 people who I think deserve a mention and made me say &#8220;wow&#8221; when I first learned about them. They are all doing or have done very unique things abroad, but the bond that ties them together is that they are all living creatively and passionately on their own terms.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s get started!</p>
<h4><span id="more-1749"></span></h4>
<h4><strong>1 &amp; 2) Alex Navarrete and Crystal Bodell &#8211; <a href="http://borntobackpack.com/" target="_blank">Born to Backpack</a></strong></h4>
<div id="attachment_1759" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 160px"><a href="http://atlassliced.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/btb.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1759" alt="born to backpack" src="http://atlassliced.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/btb-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Hiking and sporting the BTB t-shirts!</p></div>
<p><strong>Wow Factor: </strong>Raise the roof wow</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong> This under 30 dynamic duo saved up money from their jobs and started a new eco-friendly apparel line that redefines what it means to be a global citizen. After months of hard work and planning, they decided to quit their day jobs and take their biz on the road with them, as they manage everything remotely and travel the world. Can&#8217;t wait to air their episode slice (stay tuned for a contest in the near future). I feel honored and privileged to know them personally and have a tremendous amount of respect for these global entrepreneurs. Alex and Crystal are a super friendly couple, so make sure to say hello to them on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/borntobackpack" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/followtripp" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</p>
<h4><strong>3) Hilary Corna &#8211; Founder of <a href="http://liveandworkabroad.org/" target="_blank">LiveAndWorkAbroad.org</a> and author of <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1463699344/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1463699344&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=atlaslic-20">One White Face</a></em></strong><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" alt="" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=atlaslic-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1463699344" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></h4>
<div id="attachment_1710" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 160px"><a href="http://atlassliced.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/hilary-corna.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1710" alt="hilary corna" src="http://atlassliced.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/hilary-corna-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Hilary Corna</p></div>
<p><strong>Wow Factor: </strong>Jump out of my seat wow</p>
<p><strong>Why? </strong><a href="http://atlassliced.com/one-white-face/" target="_blank">Former guest</a> Hilary Corna went into the international corporate world after graduating from university. The crazy part is how she got her job with Toyota Motor Asia Pacific in Singapore, after buying a one-way ticket with no plans. It all started in a swimming pool. Seriously. She was the &#8220;one white face&#8221; in her Singapore office, and her story of working in Asia&#8217;s corporate culture is so unique that I couldn&#8217;t put her book down when I was reading it. Give Hilary some love on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/#!/pages/Hilary-Corna-OneWhiteFacecom/130263603695690" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/HilaryCorna" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</p>
<h4><strong>4) Turner Barr &#8211; <a href="http://aroundtheworldin80jobs.com/" target="_blank">Around the World in 80 Jobs</a></strong></h4>
<div id="attachment_1468" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 160px"><a href="http://atlassliced.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/turner.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1468" alt="turner barr" src="http://atlassliced.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/turner-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Turner Barr doing an odd job</p></div>
<p><strong>Wow Factor:</strong> Jaw dropping wow</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong> <a href="http://atlassliced.com/want-a-job-abroad/" target="_blank">Atlas Sliced alum</a> Turner Barr might be a little bit crazy. And that&#8217;s why I like him. He&#8217;s just so darn unconventional that I always want to know what he&#8217;s up to next. For those who don&#8217;t know him, he goes all over the world picking up odd jobs (ex. harvesting tequila in Mexico, making pizza in Rome, street salesman in Thailand) to support his lifestyle. Give him a shout out on <a href="https://twitter.com/80worldjobs" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and follow him on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Around-the-World-in-80-Jobs/286784508024000" target="_blank">Facebook</a>. His Facebook updates are hilarious.</p>
<h4><strong>5) Sherry Ott &#8211; Creator of <a href="http://www.ottsworld.com/" target="_blank">Ottsworld</a> and Co-founder of <a href="http://meetplango.com/" target="_blank">Meet Plan Go!</a></strong></h4>
<div id="attachment_1760" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 160px"><a href="http://atlassliced.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/sherry-ott.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1760" alt="sherry ott" src="http://atlassliced.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/sherry-ott-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sherry Ott (Photo taken from Ottsworld.com)</p></div>
<p><strong>Wow Factor: </strong>Bust out the jello shots wow</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong> Sherry Ott quit her New York corporate IT job in 2006 to travel. She&#8217;s not just a typical traveler who writes and takes photos about her experiences. She&#8217;s an entrepreneur. Sherry turned her corporate runaway story into a way to help others escape the cubicle by creating Meet Plan Go!, which offers career break planning and advice through online courses and events across North America. She is also a <a href="http://www.ottsworld.com/blogs/the-era-of-the-new-nomad/" target="_blank">&#8220;new nomad.&#8221;</a> Make sure to connect with her on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/Ottsworldtravel" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/ottsworld" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. Did I mention she likes jello shots?</p>
<h4><strong>6) Jodi Ettenberg &#8211; Creator of <a href="http://www.legalnomads.com/" target="_blank">Legal Nomads</a> and author of <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0987706160/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0987706160&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=atlaslic-20">The Food Traveler&#8217;s Handbook</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" alt="" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=atlaslic-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0987706160" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></em></strong></h4>
<div id="attachment_1761" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 160px"><a href="http://atlassliced.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/jodi.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1761" alt="Jodi Ettenberg" src="http://atlassliced.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/jodi.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Jodi Ettenberg (Photo taken from LegalNomads.com)</p></div>
<p><strong>Wow Factor: </strong>Hot damn! wow</p>
<p><strong>Why? </strong>As the name of her site suggests, Jodi Ettenberg used to be a lawyer. But those days are long gone. She had been set on traveling the world most of her life, but she needed to save up money before she could do it. What&#8217;s so cool about her is that she keeps her site ad-free and supports herself through partnerships that she has created with others. Oh, and I almost forgot to mention that she&#8217;s a food enthusiast and wrote a book (see title above) about finding &#8220;cheap, safe and delicious food anywhere in the world.&#8221; I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;d appreciate connecting on <a href="http://facebook.com/LegalNomads" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/legalnomads" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</p>
<h4><strong>7) Shannon O&#8217;Donnell &#8211; Creator of <a href="http://alittleadrift.com/" target="_blank">A Little Adrift</a>, <a href="http://grassrootsvolunteering.org/" target="_blank">Grassroots Volunteering</a> and author of <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0987706144/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0987706144&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=atlaslic-20">The Volunteer Traveler&#8217;s Handbook</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" alt="" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=atlaslic-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0987706144" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></em></strong></h4>
<div id="attachment_1776" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 160px"><a href="http://atlassliced.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/About-Shannon-ODonnell-654x413.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1776" alt="Shannon O'Donnell" src="http://atlassliced.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/About-Shannon-ODonnell-654x413-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Shannon O&#8217;Donnell (Photo taken from ALittleAdrift.com)</p></div>
<p><strong>Wow Factor: </strong>Epiphany-inducing wow</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong> <a href="http://atlassliced.com/episode-slice-17-volunteering-around-the-world-with-shannon-odonnell/" target="_blank">Another Atlas Sliced alum</a>, Shannon O&#8217;Donnell has taken her skills on the road with her over the years, as she works basically anywhere in the world doing freelance writing, SEO consulting, and online marketing. She has also volunteered extensively and wrote a book (see above title). Another very unique quirk about her is that she took her young niece, who was homeschooled at the time, along with her for an extended period of her travels. What an awesome aunt! Track her down on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/alittleadrift" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/shannonrtw" target="_blank">Twitter</a> to say hello.</p>
<h4><strong>8) Marcello Arrambide &#8211; Creator of <a href="http://wanderingtrader.com/" target="_blank">Wandering Trader</a> and <a href="http://thedaytradingacademy.com/" target="_blank">The Day Trading Academy</a></strong></h4>
<div id="attachment_1778" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 160px"><a href="http://atlassliced.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/marcello-home-about-link.png"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1778" alt="Marcello Arrambide" src="http://atlassliced.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/marcello-home-about-link-150x150.png" width="150" height="150" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Marcello Arrambide (Photo taken from WanderingTrader.com)</p></div>
<p><strong>Wow Factor:</strong> Off the charts impressive wow</p>
<p><strong>Why? </strong>I&#8217;ll be honest. To me, day trading looks like a cluster of graphs, numbers, and confusion. But Marcello Arrambide seems to have cracked the code. He makes a living day trading and training people how to day trade. Major props to him because this is something I don&#8217;t think I could do. All the while, he travels to off the beaten path countries like South Sudan and Suriname. He&#8217;s living life on the wild side! Give Marcello a holler on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/WanderingTrader" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Wanderingtradr" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</p>
<h4><strong>9 &amp; 10) Christine and Drew Gilbert &#8211; Creators of <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/almostfearless/the-wireless-generation" target="_blank">The Wireless Generation</a> (documentary) and <a href="http://almostfearless.com/" target="_blank">Almost Fearless </a>(Christine)</strong></h4>
<div id="attachment_1781" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 160px"><a href="http://atlassliced.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/gilberts.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1781" alt="Gilberts" src="http://atlassliced.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/gilberts-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Drew and Christine Gilbert. Photo taken from their Kickstarter campaign.</p></div>
<p><strong>Wow Factor:</strong> Fist pump wow</p>
<p><strong>Why? </strong>This couple left the U.S. to pursue traveling the world in 2008. Oh, and they had a baby while on the road (probably <em>two</em> babies by the time you read this). No big deal. I&#8217;m super stoked for the release of their documentary, which is about a &#8220;new generation of people taking their careers online in order to travel the world.&#8221; Seriously A-MAZ-ING. Connect with Christine on <a href="http://facebook.com/almostfearless" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/almostfearless" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</p>
<h4><strong>Bonus (two people you probably already know about but need to be mentioned)</strong></h4>
<p><strong><a href="http://chrisguillebeau.com/" target="_blank">Chris Guillebeau</a>:</strong> Chris elicits an &#8220;I don&#8217;t even know what to say&#8221; wow. He is an entrepreneur, an author, a speaker, and a travel hacker who has been to almost EVERY COUNTRY in the world (soon to be all). I could write a ton about him, but if you don&#8217;t know him, get your head out from under a rock and head over to his site.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wherethehellismatt.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Where the Hell is Matt?</strong></a> Makes me wanna do a happy dance wow. Long story short (read the full story on his site), Matt started doing a silly dance all over the world, and he filmed it. It caught on big time. Now he makes a living through speaking engagements, endorsements, and appearances.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://atlassliced.com/one-white-face/"><![CDATA[<p>This episode slice has been a long time coming. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/OneWhiteFace" target="_blank">Hilary Corna</a> and I had been trying to  nail down an interview for the LONGEST time. We finally did it, and here it is. Hilary is the author of the memoir <a href="http://www.onewhiteface.com/" target="_blank">One White Face</a>, founder of <a href="http://liveandworkabroad.org/" target="_blank">LiveAndWorkAbroad.org</a>, and a public speaker (TEDx Talk is <a href="http://youtu.be/EBZzb7x1-6s" target="_blank">here</a>). She has a really unique story because she <span style="text-decoration: underline;">went into the international corporate world</span> after graduating from university.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the super cliffs notes version. She bought a one-way ticket to Singapore and gave herself two months to find a job. She &#8220;found&#8221; a great position (You will want to know how. It&#8217;s amazing.) with Toyota Motor Asia Pacific, and as the title of her book implies, she was the &#8220;one white face&#8221; working there. I highly recommend that you read her <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1463699344/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1463699344&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=atlaslic-20">book</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" alt="" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=atlaslic-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1463699344" width="1" height="1" border="0" />.</p>
<p><span id="more-1709"></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Here are some highlights from the interview</span></p>
<ul>
<li>How she wouldn&#8217;t have gotten the position had she been working in the U.S.</li>
<li>Major differences between Asian work culture and Western work culture and why people &#8220;fail&#8221; at jobs overseas</li>
<li>Advice on landing a job abroad</li>
<li>Why keeping a notebook or journal with you when you are abroad is a great idea</li>
<li>How building connections plays a big role</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8230; and SO MUCH MORE!</p>
<p>Hilary is the epitome of a global citizen.
